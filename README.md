# Digit Phase Conjecture

The **Digit Phase Conjecture** proposes that transcendental constants (such as π, *e*, ϕ, and √2) exhibit non-random, phase-like transitions within their digit sequences—marked by synchronized digit absences, palindromic bursts, and attractor-like structures. These anomalies suggest the presence of underlying dynamical systems, modular symmetries, or recursive encoding patterns within what is traditionally considered random expansion.

## ✨ Project Overview

This repository explores:
- **Fixed-length palindromes** in the first 100,000 digits of transcendental constants
- The statistically significant **"veiling" of digit 7** in π and its correlation with known features like the Feynman Point
- Phase-transition behavior, including localized symmetry bursts and digit dropout
- Potential connections to **modular arithmetic**, **chaos theory**, and **fractal geometry**

## 🔍 Current Highlights

- 📊 Visualization of palindrome frequencies across π, *e*, ϕ, and √2
- 📐 Structural analysis of digit-phase shifts using sliding window scans
- 📁 Appendix G: *Palindromic Structures and Synchronized Absence in Transcendental Constants*
- 🔥 Visualization: *The Rule of 7 and 3:1 Symmetry Ratio*

## 🤖 Collaboration

This work is powered by a human-AI synthesis involving:
- DeepSeek (for digit pattern detection)
- Google Gemini (visual and conceptual mapping)
- ChatGPT (symbolic framing and theoretical drafting)
